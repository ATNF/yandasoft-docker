# yandasoft-docker
docker files for yandasoft development

REQUIREMENTS

All you should need is docker and docker-compose

HOWTO: 

INITIALLY Just run ./start.py and the DOcker image will be built with a default user (yanda pw. yanda). Then a service will be started using docker-compose - which creates a container running with an open ssh port (port 2223). SO you can ssh <into> the image by:

```
> ssh -p 2223 yanda@localhost
```
the p/w is just yanda.

SHUTDOWN:

```
docker-compose down
```

NOTE ON CONFIGURATION

Just edit the docker-compose.yml to change the configuration.

By default the UID of the yanda user is 1000 you can change this to your own UID/GID - which means any files generated by the container will be accessable by you and vice versa.
By default the BASE IMAGE is the all_yandasoft image used in the build CI
By default the ssh port is 2223
By default the WORKING IMAGE is yanda-dev:latest

Note: the yanda user has sudo access in the container if you need to install anything. Note if you do change your environent and want it to stay you will need to save the running container.

```
docker commit yanda-dev <repo>:tag
```

You would be better off editing the DOckerfile for posterity or making your own,
